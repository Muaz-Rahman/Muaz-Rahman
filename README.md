# Congratulations, you have reached Muaz! ü•¥

I am a software engineer who likes trying out new frameworks to get a better understanding of how the solutions of a problem are supposed to work and gain insight from them.
As of my writing this, I am a fresh graduate and looking for a place to get hands on opportunity to become the best ~~cheesecake~~ programmer ever. 

# ü§î I am mostly interested in:
 - Web & mobile app development
 - Computer networks
 - IoT (Growing interest)

# ‚ö° Facts about me: 
 - I am a **Muslim**, the rules of Islam dictate my way of life. Period.
 - I like studying different languages, target is to reach 5 languages with all 4 skills at a satisfactory level.
 - I like reading books, novels specially.
 - I like medieval weapons and the art of using them (HEMA is cool), swords and spears at the top of my list. Gonna start a collection someday. ‚öîÔ∏è
 - I like chilling out. I love chilling out. One of my most favorite activities is to sit somewhere and space out, `System Idle Process at 100%` .
 - I am a very very average programmer. I just have a habit of not stopping before the problem is solved (and I love to suffer, of course) so I end up getting some results- after a lot of headbanging.
